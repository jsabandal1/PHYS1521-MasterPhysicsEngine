            Tests the method in the Calculator class that calculates the length of
            a line segment between two Eng_Point2D points A and B.
            Note that there are two sets of data, one will be from the Instructor, which
            will give you a passed test if your method works. The other set of data is your
            student data and will pass if the student has calculated the expected answer
            correctly.

            This method holds object-based data to be used for the TestMidPoint test method.
            The TestMidPoint method returns a Eng_Point2D data type theefore this is the means
            to test this type of method.
